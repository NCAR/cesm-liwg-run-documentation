The files in this directory document the run setup for a number of simulations
that test the sensitivity of the coupled simulation to the consistency (or lack
thereof) between CAM's topographic height and the mean topographic height of
grid cells in CLM, arising from glc_mec columns.

The following runs are included here:

(1) Control: essentially an out-of-the-box run

(2) AllToposEqualCAM: All elevation classes have their topographic heights
    modified to equal the CAM topographic height in that grid cell. (We could
    therefore use a single elevation class in each grid cell, but for simplicity
    of coding, we are using multiple "elevation classes", all at the same
    topographic height.)

(3) CAMForcingAtMeanHeight: Here, the CLM elevation classes maintain their true
    topographic distribution. But when we set the topographic height at which
    the CAM forcing is assumed to apply, we use the mean topographic height of
    the CLM columns rather than using CAM's actual topographic height.

So, note that (1) has potential adjustment of the mean CAM forcings in each grid
cell. (2) and (3), in contrast, should have grid cell mean forcings close to the
CAM forcings (although there may be small discrepancies in (3) due to the
non-linearity of some downscaling methods).
